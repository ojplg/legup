<h4>Illinois Bill</h4>

<p>The system described in the Illinois Bill
    (<a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?GA=100&DocTypeID=SB&DocNum=780&GAID=14&SessionID=91&LegID=102091">SB0780</a>)
is the pernicious Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) form of ranked choice voting, not the much preferred Condorcet form.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of all these systems, and I will not go into detail, but just give one example
of why Condorcet is far superior.</p>

<h4>Ranked Choice Voting</h4>

<p>Both Condorcet and IRV are forms of Ranked Choice Voting. Instead of picking one of several candidates,
a voter can rank all the candidates in order of preference from first to last. Though that is not required.
A ballot can indicate preferences for as many or as few candidates as the voter wishes. Unranked candidates
are all considered to be equally undesirable.</p>

<p>Any election counting system (except for deliberately crazy ones: person with fewest votes wins) will
lead to the same outcomes and incentives in the case of landslides. If large majorities of voters prefer
a particular candidate over all others, even single vote, first-past-the-post systems work fine.</p>

<p>When there are many candidates, and voters prefer them in idiosyncratic ways, problems arise. And
when there is no clear majority first-place candidate, elections must be resolved according to some
process.</p>

<h4>Instant Runoff Voting</h4>

<p>In IRV voting, such as the Illinois bill referenced above, ballots are counted in successive rounds,
paring down the available candidates in each round.</p>

<p>To interpret a ballot, you look for the highest ranked candidate who has not been eliminated. That counts
for one vote for that candidate. In each round, at least one candidate (the one with the least votes) is
eliminated from consideration, until only two candidates remain and a majority winner is determined.</p>

<h4>Condorcet Voting</h4>

<p>Condorcet voting (or really, Condorcet counting) works differently. Instead of successive rounds of eliminations, each ballot
is interpreted as a collection of pairwise contests between candidates. The pairwise totals are added up
across all ballots, and if a clear winner emerges (one candidate beats all the others), that
person is the winner. If it emerges that there is a cycle (e.g. A beats B, B beats C, and C beats
A), more sophisticated methods are used. There are a number of methods, but basically you drop the
most marginal preferences until a winner remains.</p>

<h4>Why prefer Condorcet?</h4>

<p>The easiest way to see that Condorcet style systems are preferable is by example.
Imagine an election between 4 candidates: A, B, C, and D, in a population of 100 voters.
    The ballots are submitted as follows (recall that unmentioned candidates are considered
    equally unpreferred):</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Order of Candidates</th><th>Vote Total</th></tr>
    <tr><td>A, D</td><td>31</td></tr>
    <tr><td>B, D</td><td>30</td></tr>
    <tr><td>C, D</td><td>29</td></tr>
    <tr><td>D</td><td>10</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Who should be the winner of this election? Clearly, it is candidate D. Though few people
preferred D over everyone in the field, everyone expressed a preference for D.</p>

<p>How does IRV resolve this election? Well, in the first round the votes are counted.
A has 31, B 30, C 29, and D 10. No one has a majority, so the lowest vote getter is eliminated.
Goodbye to candidate D. In succesive rounds, C and B are eliminated, and A is the winner.</p>

<p>How does Condorcet resolve this election? First we interpret all the ballots as pairwise
preferences. A ballot that marks A as first choice and D as second choice is really saying:
A > B, A > C, A > D, D > B, D > C and no preference between B and C. We could change the
ballot to a chart that looks like this.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th></th><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th><th>D</th></tr>
    <tr><td class="first">A</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="first">B</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td class="first">C</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td class="first">D</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>To read this chart, read across the rows to see how many votes were cast that
prefer the candidate starting that row to the candidate specified in the column.
To interpret one ballot this way is a bit strange, but the point is that we can
now add all the ballots up, and end up with this chart.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th></th><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th><th>D</th></tr>
    <tr><td class="first">A</td><td></td><td>31</td><td>31</td><td>31</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="first">B</td><td>30</td><td></td><td>30</td><td>30</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="first">C</td><td>29</td><td>29</td><td></td><td>29</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="first">D</td><td>69</td><td>70</td><td>71</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Now we can simply determine who wins by comparing the votes cast in each
contest in both directions. Did A beat B? Well, reading the chart indicates that
A was preferred to B 31 times, and B to A 30 times. So, A beats B. Similarly,
A beats C 31 to 29. But D beat A 69 to 31.</p>

<p>In fact, D beats each of the other three candidates in pairwise contests, so
D is the winner.</p>

<p>IRV delivered the wrong result, Condorcet delivered the correct one.</p>

<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

<p>The example above is a bit artificial, obviously. But the point remains:
IRV systems tend to eliminate broadly acceptable candidates and elevate fringe
    ones. And in the US, fringe means racist.</p>

<p>IRV also suffers from another problem: the need to vote strategically. Every
election system has circumstances where you have to balance your genuine preferences
with the need for avoiding terrible outcomes. Condorcet is
very good in this regard: generally you can express your preferences assured that
they will not lead to a disaster. In IRV, you have exactly the same problem as
in single-choice, first-past-the-post elections. If broadly acceptable (but moderate)
candidate does not get enough first place votes, instead those votes are divided
among the Green Party, the Racial Justice Party, the Feminist Party, etc, than
the acceptable moderate gets dropped, and perhaps the end winner is the dreaded
white nationalist. In fact, in some ways IRV might be even worse than our current
system, since it gives you the illusion of safely expressing your true beliefs,
but you cannot actually do so.</p>
